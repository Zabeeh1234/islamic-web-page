        <h1>SIX BELEIVE IN ISLAM</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="container1">
        <p>Belief in God</p>
        <span class="time-right">Islam emphasizes that God is The One without partner, The Encompassing of all that
            exists, and He is unique in every way. Only God, The Most Benevolent, has the right to be worshiped.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="container1 darker">
        <p>Belief in His Angels</p>
        <span class="time-left">The angels are creations of God. God, The Originator, created them from light. They are
            powerful, and always do precisely as they are commanded by God.

            God has revealed to us the names and the duties of some of the angels. A Muslim must believe in the
            existence of angels. Gabriel and Michael are among the angels mentioned in the Qur’an. For instance, it is
            Gabriel’s duty to take God’s revelation to the Prophets and Messengers</span>
    </div>

    <div class="container1">
        <p>Belief in His Books</p>
        <span class="time-right">Muslims believe in all of the original scriptures revealed by God to His Messengersp. A
            Muslim must believe in every scripture mentioned by God in the Qur’an. God, The Giver, revealed them and
            they were, in their original forms, the actual word of God. The scriptures God mentions in the Qur’an are as
            follows:

            The original Scrolls as revealed to Abrahamp
            The original Torah as revealed to Mosesp
            The original Psalms as revealed to Davidp
            The original Injeel (Gospel of Jesus) as revealed to Jesusp
            The Qur’an as revealed to Muhammadp (which is still available in its original form)
            Muslims do not consider the scriptures revealed before the Qur’an, which are presently in circulation in
            various editions and versions, to be an accurate representation of their original revealed form. According
            to the Qur’an, people have distorted these scriptures for their own worldly gain. These distortions have
            occurred in many different ways, such as additions or deletions of text or changes in the meaning or the
            language. These distortions were adopted over time and what remains is a mixture of the original divine text
            with man made interpretation and contamination. Although Muslims believe in all the previous revealed books,
            the final means by which they judge different matters and seek ultimate guidance is sought through the
            Qur’an and the authentic traditions of the Prophet Muhammadp.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="container1 darker">
        <p>Belief in His Prophets and Messengers</p>
        <span class="time-left">In Islam, Muhammad p has the distinction of being God’s final Messenger and the Seal of
            the Prophets. The reason for this is, first, because God completed His revelations to humanity and perfectly
            preserved them forever in the Qur’an, and second, His final Prophet and Messenger p led an exemplary life
            for the twenty-three years of his Prophethood, establishing clear guidelines for all generations to follow.
            God says in the Qur’an that no Prophet or Messenger will come after him. This is the reason Muhammad p is
            known as the Seal of the Prophets. This means the divine law that was revealed and embodied in the teachings
            of Prophet Muhammad p is for all of humanity until the Day of Resurrection (Day of Judgment). To be a
            believer, it is obligatory to believe in Muhammadp and the laws that have been revealed through him, as well
            as in all the Prophets and Messengers of God who came before. Muhammadp and the Prophets and Messengers p
            before him also had to believe in, obey, and surrender to The Almighty God. Although Muslims believe in all
            the Prophets and Messengersp of God, they follow and emulate the teachings and example of the final
            Messenger Muhammadp. God The Most Glorious, states about Muhammadp, “And We have not sent you, but as a
            mercy to the worlds.” [Qur’an 21:107]</span>
    </div>

    <div class="container1">
        <p>Belief in the Day of Judgment</p>
        <span class="time-right">Muslims must believe, without any doubt, in the Day of Judgment and the physical
            resurrection when the body will be recreated and the soul will surely be reunited with the body by God’s
            unlimited power. Just as God, The Gatherer of Mankind, created us the first time, He is surely The
            Resurrector who will bring us forth from death to stand in perfect judgment before Him. After the Day of
            Judgment, death will no longer be, and our existence will be forever. The Day of Judgment is when each and
            every individual will stand before The Creator and be questioned about his or her deeds. On that momentous
            day, we will each see in detail the results of even the smallest good and the smallest evil we have set
            forth in this life. On that day, lying and deception will no longer be possible. The ultimate reward is
            Paradise and the penalty is Hell. Heaven and Hell are literal places that actually exist. They are not
            symbols or metaphors.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="container1 darker">
        <p>Belief in God’s Divine Decree</p>
        <span class="time-left">God, in His timelessness, knows everything that goes on in His creation. From the
            perspective of temporal beings like us, this means that God, The Ever Watching, knows everything that
            happened in the past, everything that is now taking place, and everything that will happen in the future.
            God’s divine knowledge is perfect. God is The All Knowing, and all that He knows will come to pass.

            God, The Subduer, has absolute sovereignty over His creation. Everything that exists within His creation and
            every event that occurs is a direct result of His creating it. Nothing happens in creation except by His
            power, His will, and His knowledge.</span>
